SHIP is administered by United Healthcare. The Plans meet all of the student health insurance standards developed by the American College Health Association.SHIP is tailor-made for the college population.Provides continuous coverage at a reasonable cost for most on or off-campus medical care over Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer Semesters.Covers pre-existing medical conditions & preventative care.Annual deductible $200 for an individual.Annual out of pocket limit of $3,000 which includes deductibles, copays and coinsurance.Covers inpatient and outpatient mental health care.No deductible applied to prescription drug coverage.Please note: Office visits for Primary Care and Specialists have a $35 copayment with 0% coinsurance with a referral and 30% coinsurance without a referral.Emergency Room vs. Urgent Care: Only Emergency Services for the treatment of an Emergency Condition are covered in an ER.Emergency Room: $100 copay after policy year deductible then you pay 20% coinsurance (copayment/coinsurance waived if hospital admission).Urgent Care: $35 copay after policy year deductible then you pay 0% for cost-sharing.The fee is billed to your student account in SOLAR. Just like all other tuition & fees, this charge is payable by cash, check, money order, credit card or through financial aid.

Prior to joining SBU in 2011, he was in Boston working with Professor Sandor Vajda's Structural Bioinformatics Group at Boston University, and Professor Charles Leiserson's SuperTech Research Group at MIT. Before moving to Boston, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Computational Visualization (CVC), Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences (ICES), University of Texas at Austin. He worked with Professor Chandrajit Bajaj. Chowdhury now leads the Theoretical and Experimental Algorithmics (TEA) Group where they concentrate on both algorithm design and algorithm engineering. He holda a joint appointment with the Institute for Advanced Computational Sciences (IACS).Rezaul Chowdhury is currently involved in an NSF-funded project with Charles Leiserson and Steven Johnson of MIT on building a stencil computation compiler called \"Pochoir\". A stencil defines the value of a grid point in a d-dimensional spatial grid at time t as a function of neighboring grid points at recent times before t. Stencil computations are conceptually simple to implement using nested loops, but looping implementations suffer from poor cache performance on multicore processors. Cache-efficient divide-and-conquer stencil algorithms exist, but most programmers find them difficult to implement. Moreover, open problems remain in adapting these algorithms to realistic applications that lack the perfect regularity of simple examples. This research aims to develop a language embedded in C++ that can express stencil computations concisely and can be compiled automatically into highly efficient algorithmic code that will make good use of the memory hierarchy and processor pipelines endemic to multicore processors and will run fast on a diverse set of hardware platforms. A wide variety of stencil-based applications \u2014 ranging across physics, biology, chemistry, energy, climate, mechanical and electrical engineering, finance, and other areas \u2014 will become easier to develop and maintain. Some of his other projects focus on efficient resource-oblivious algorithms, fast energetics computation, and protein-protein docking Awards. Rezaul Chowdhury is a recipient of the prestigious NSF CAREER Award. Rezaul Chowdhury received a best paper award in IPDPS 2010 for introducing the notion of multicore-oblivious algorithms.
