In 1998, the University became one of the top 100 of American research universities in the U.S. News & World Report, and its relatively affordable tuition placed it among the best values among universities in the nation. That same year, the University and Battelle Memorial Institute were chosen by the Department of Energy as joint operators of the Brookhaven National Laboratories, joining a selective group of universities that operated national laboratories across the nation. Enrollment reached the 20,000 mark in 2001, and the administration\\'s improvement efforts climaxed with the invitation to the highly selective Association of American Universities, an organization of sixty-two universities across North America committed to a strong system of research and education, becoming only the third public university in the northeast to receive such invitation (Buffalo and Rutgers admitted in 1989). 2002 saw the opening of the $22 million Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium and the inauguration of the massive Charles B. Wang Center dedicated to Asian and American culture, funded by a $50 million donation from Charles B. Wang. At the time, it was the largest private donation to a SUNY institution. In 2003, chemistry professor Paul Lauterbur received a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research and discovery of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, which was instrumental in the development of NMR Imaging (MRI) while at Stony Brook.

The late 2000s saw the University receive historic philanthropic donations. Hedge funder Jim Simons made multiple multi-million donations, including a $25 million donation to the Stony Brook Foundation in 2006, a $60 million donation for the development of the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics in 2008, and a landmark $150 million donation to the University in 2011.

In January 1968, the infamous \\\\u201cOperation Stony Brook\\\\u201d drug raid resulted in the arrest of twenty nine students and in the fall of 1968, tension climaxed as the administration and students decided on a three-day moratorium to bring together the entire university with the goal of improving communication between the students, faculty, and administration. Despite the initiatives of the \\\\u201cThree Days\\\\u201d in improving the campus, in February 1973, a tragedy occurred when a freshman student fell to his death into one of the many uncovered steam pipe manholes at the University.The 1970s witnessed the growth of the University and its transformation as a major research institution of the SUNY system with strong graduate programs and scientific breakthroughs like development of magnetic resonance imaging. But the University lagged significantly in undergraduate education, prioritizing graduate education and research over undergraduate studies and student life. By 1975, enrollment had reached 16,000 and expansion crossed over Nicolls Road with the construction of the Health Science Center, which would be completed in 1980. In 1981, John Marburger was inaugurated as the third president of the University and continued the expansion of the institution. By the late 1980s, the administration affirmed the need to improve other areas of the institution, which included undergraduate education, student and residential life, and intercollegiate athletics. The University approved a decision to transition athletics to the Division I of the NCAA and followed with the construction of the Stony Brook Arena and the expansion of the Indoor Sports Complex.\", \"qas\": [{\"answers\": [{\"answer_start\": 0, \"text\": \"\"}], \"question\": \"How many students were enrolled in 1962?\", \"id\": \"720\"}]}, {\"context\": \"=== Southampton Campus === On March 24, 2006, the University completed the purchase of the 81-acre (330,000 m2) Southampton College (on the east end of Long Island) property from Long Island University with the intent to develop it as a full college campus focusing on academic programs related to the environment and sustainability. Stony Brook expanded its original program, started in the fall of 2005, when it offered an undergraduate marine sciences program, with teaching and research facilities at the campus leased from Long Island University. An enrollment of about 2,000 students is expected within the next five years. Professor Martin Schoonen was appointed interim dean of Southampton campus on August 3, 2006, and conservationist Mary Pearl was appointed dean and vice president in March 2009. On April 7, 2010, the University had suspended residential programs and transferred sustainability programs to the main campus. The change was prompted by severe state budget cuts. Although the Marine Sciences and Graduate Writing programs are still in session at Southampton, undergraduates were relocated to the main campus. As a result of the suspension of residential programs, all dining services and retail operations were suspended by the Faculty Student Association. The old LIU radio station and National Public Radio affiliate no longer operate on the campus. In September 2011 Stony Brook Southampton began offering an undergraduate program called Semester by the Sea, where students attend undergraduate classes to study the Ocean or the Arts. Students studying the Ocean are immersed in marine topics that are enhanced with close proximity to the water, a fleet of research vessels and graduate research projects that are ongoing. Students studying the Arts are engaged in studies for filmmaking and creative writing who interract with Master\\'s of Fine Arts students plus notable filmmakers and authors being part of the cultural legacy of the Hamptons. Both programs offer a Public Lecture Series which connect highly prestigious scientists and writers with the community. As of 2015, the Stony Brook Southampton campus has shown growth, despite almost being closed down in 2010. Programs had been added back and the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York approved a long-awaited partnership agreement between Southampton and Stony Brook University hospitals.

Plans for a law school were in the talks but scrapped shortly after.In 2009, president Shirley Strum Kenny stepped down and in May 2009 Dr. Samuel Stanley Jr was announced as Stony Brook\\'s fifth president. The late 2000s (decade) saw the University receive historic philanthropic donations with Jim Simons making multiple multi-million donations: including: $25 million donations to the Stony Brook Foundation in 2006, a $60 million donation for the development of the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics in 2008, and a landmark $150 million donation to the University in 2011. Other major donations were provided by alumni Joe Nathan, Stuart Goldstein, and Glenn Dubin for major renovation of athletic facilities. In 2010 Stanley announced Project 50 Forward, a comprehensive plan for the development of the University in the next fifty years with a focus on \\\\u201coperational excellence, academic greatness, and building for the future\\\\u201d.2012 saw the approval of state legislation allowing University Centers to rationalize tuition increases for the next five years and the inclusion of a capital challenge grant for each University, a landmark bill providing greater autonomy for the centers known as SUNY 2020. Stony Brook saw the completion of the long-awaited Campus Recreation Center and the on-campus hotel. The renovation of the old-chemistry building and its conversion to a classroom building was done by Flad Architects, the design team, and Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the structural engineers. More recently, Stony Brook has completed a $40.8 million construction of a new Computer Science building in July 2015 and the $21 million overhaul of the Stony Brook Arena was completed in October 2014. Stony Brook has also completed construction of a new residential campus adjacent the Wang Center, called C\\\\u00e9sar Ch\\\\u00e1vez Hall & Harriet Tubman Hall. Renovation of the Stony Brook Union is underway and the construction of the $194 million Medical and Research Translational building is scheduled to open in the coming months. In 2018 Stony Brook received its best ranking ever in the National University category of U.S. News & World Report ranked the 80th Best University, and 32nd Best Public in Undergraduate education.\", \"qas\": [{\"answers\": [{\"answer_start\": 0, \"text\": \"\"}], \"question\": \"To whom Joe Nathan Field is dedicated to?\", \"id\": \"1080\"}]}, {\"context\": \"Stony Brook has a wide variety of student-run organizations on campus, which include sororities and fraternities, and a count of almost 300 recognized student clubs and organizations.
